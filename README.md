An OS X dashboard widget to conveniently generate strong passwords. Nothing special, just me being paranoid that my password generator does something odd.

# Install

Just download the [Password.wdgt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sebastianludwig/PasswordWidget/master/Password.wdgt), open it and it will be installed on your OS X dashboard.
